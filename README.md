# MatchBot
Matchbot is CS:GO match managing bot. It is intended to allow managed Scrims, 10-mans, and Matches, using only the official vanilla server.
It allows a match admin to initiate a game, or series of games, and teams to ready up and pause using chat commands.
It is able to handle multiple servers from one instance, making it perfect for managing a tournament off one PC.
